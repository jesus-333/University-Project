# University-Project
Public repository with all the report of all the project that I develop during University. 

* A Deterministic Approach to Boat and Sea Detection: Deterministic algorithm that used OpenCV function to detectec boats and seas inside images. Develop in C++. For the code write me.
* An Augmented Reality Application with Hand Detection and Gesture Recognition: report about the final project of an augmented reality course. The project use two different algorithms(one with OpenCV function and the other with Pytorch R-CNN) to track hands in real time. Both algorithm are develop in Python and work together the Unity 3D game engine. The repositories of this project can be find at this [link (1)](https://github.com/jesus-333/Hand-Tracking-Pytorch) and this [link (2)](https://github.com/jesus-333/Unity-hand-tracking).
* Arrhythmia classification using a cascade of binary classifiers based on multi-branch convolutional Neural Network: Neural network develop in Keras e Tensorflow to classify ECG. For the code write me. 
* Autoencoder - MNIST dataset: Autoencoder trained on the MNIST dataset. For the code write me.
* Emotional BCI: Review report of the use of BCI in emotional recognition.
* Network analysis of tweet's sentiment: project to study the network of words under the comment of famous people on twitter. Develop in Python with Tweepy And Networkx. For the code write me.
* Recurrent Neural Network - Text Generation: Pytorch RNN create to generate text. Version 1 was trained on the *Divina Commedia* of Dante Alighieri and Version 2 on *Gerusalemme Liberata* of Torquato Tasso. For the code write me.
* Reinforcement Learning -Path Exploration: handmade reinforcement learning algorithm to simulate an agent that explore an unknown place and has to find a treasure. For the code write me.
